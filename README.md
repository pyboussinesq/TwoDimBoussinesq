# TwoDimBoussinesq
A pythonic solver for the 2D (x-z) bossinesq equations. It uses streamfunction-vorticity-buoyancy formulation, and solves the equations using pseudo-spectral methods. Time-stepping is performed using a RK3-Theta method.

# pyboussinesq
This 2D code is a first step towards the main goal of the `pyboussinesq` project that aims to build
a pythonic mpi-parallelizable solver for the 3D Boussinesq equations.
